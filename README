This is a copy of the original Drunet code with a simple python wrapper writen
by Val√©ry Dewil.  It provides a single function "denoise" that is used thus:

	import drunet
	y = drunet.denoise(x, 10)

The original drunet code is taken from here: https://github.com/cszn/DPIR

The weights of the model can be downloaded by the script provided on the
"model_zoo" folder.

NOTE: this interface is used mainly by ipol.py:

	!pip install clipol
	import ipol
	y = ipol.drunet(x, 10)

The code of clipol available here: https://git.sr.ht/~coco/clipol
